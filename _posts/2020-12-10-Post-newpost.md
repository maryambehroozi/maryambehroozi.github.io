## How Should I Study
When I started  university, I was really confused. I didn't know anything about the way I could handle my lessons so I asked my TA to give me some advice.now you'll read her advices:
*study part by part,you can underestand well in this way
*peractice math weekly 
*be active in general lessons
*while you try to test a code it could be a little hard and make you tired but never giveup and try one more time.
I wish it works for u too thanks for reading.
