hello it's me ! today im here to share my first experience of making  music with codes.i know that this file isnt nice enough but i like it this way . you know i call this file : success' travel bcs it starts with strong and calm notes like the way you spend to be successful and it's gonna get  happier rhythm like when you are finally successful and changes to slow rhythm  like what you feel actually after win.it's never  good enough for you and it is one of the saddest point of life.
